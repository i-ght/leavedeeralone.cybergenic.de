# LEAVE DEER ALONE  
  
In sylvan depths, where zephyrs softly weave,  
A lone deer, with antlers adorned in spikes,  
Finds itself ensnared in man's harsh decree.  
No crime but life, in nature's code inscribed,  
Yet judgment cold pronounces death's cruel dirge.  
  
The wardens, robed in hues of stern command,  
Declare euthanasia, a dark decree,  
A fate for one whose sin lies but in being.  
No misdeeds mar its days, but instincts pure,  
Yet humankind, with measured heart, decrees  
An end, a life deemed alien to their laws.  
  
Yet from the shadows of the ancient groves,  
A whisper rises, a silent protest swells.  
A call to arms, not armed with blades of steel,  
But empathy, defiance in the gaze.  
A plea to let the deer, in freedom's grace,  
Wander unfettered by the chains of man.  
  
For in each hoofprint etched upon the earth,  
Survival's dance, a sacred tapestry,  
And euthanasia, a harsh refrain,  
Would sever threads that bind us to the wild.  
The deer, innocent in its very breath,  
A symbol, standing at the forest's heart.  
  
Resistance grows, a fervent plea ascends,  
And shadows of arbiters of life and death,  
Meet echoes of compassion in the glade.  
A creature, emblem of untamed beauty,  
Bears witness to a choice within the soul.  
  
A tragic tale, where one must question bounds.  
Not only deer but man's pursuit of order,  
As paradise, lost, begs the question asked:  
Should nature roam unbridled, wild and free?  
In woods, the echoes lingerâ€”a profound plea.
