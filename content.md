# LEAVE DEER ALONE
In sylvan depths, where zephyrs weave their tales,  
A deer, antlers adorned with defiant spikes,  
Finds itself ensnared in man's harsh decree.  
No crime but life, in nature's code inscribed,  
Yet judgment cold pronounces death's cruel dirge.  
Robed in authority, enforcers decree  
Euthanasia, a dark fate's shadow cast.  
No misdeeds mark its days, just instincts pure,  
Yet humankind, with measured heart, decrees  
An end, a life deemed alien to their laws.  
From shadows cast by ancient groves, a plea,  
A silent protest rises, whispers swell.  
A call to arms, not armed with blades of steel,  
But empathy, defiance in the gaze.  
A plea to let the deer, in freedom's grace,  
Wander unfettered by the chains of man.  
But lo, a twist within the wooded scene,  
As those who held the power, now in fear,  
Confront the prospect of their own demise.  
The wielders of the blade, their hearts now faced  
With mirrored fate, feel the cold breath of doom.  
A metamorphosis of hearts unfolds,  
As empathy eclipses stern resolve.  
The tables turned, compassion takes its stand,  
And those who dealt in death now seek to spare.  
For in the shadows, where the echoes stir,  
A revelation dawns upon their souls.  
The deer, a symbol of untamed grace,  
Becomes a mirror for the human heart.  
In woods, a paradigm begins to shift,  
As those who held the power to condemn,  
Now face the question in the silent glade:  
Should mercy not extend to all who breathe?  
A tragic tale, where one must question bounds.    
Not only deer but man's pursuit of order,    
A transformation marks the hearts of men.  
The wielders of the blade, their hearts now turned,  
Choose mercy o'er the shadows of their past.  
Should nature roam unbridled, wild and free?    
In woods, the echoes lingerâ€”a profound plea.
